## About Me
Hello! My name is **Annie** and I'm a first year MSTC student and TA at NC State. 

*This is my first time living in Raleigh though I have lots of family that lives here that showed me around the city and the school. For a year before this I lived in London for a family situation and the time difference still has it's hold on me and so does the spelling.*
